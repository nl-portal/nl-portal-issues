# NL Portal issues and request for change (RFC)

In the `/rfcs` folder you can see the proposals for changes that are linked to issues. An issues does not necessarily mean there is an entry in the `/rfcs` folder.

The RFCs need to be prefixed with the issue number (e.g. 1-some-solution-for-something, 3-some-solution)
